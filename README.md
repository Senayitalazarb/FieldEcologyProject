## Difference of Predation Rates between Cryptic and Aposematic Strategies!
                                       using artificial caterpillars


This note discusses the importance of caterpillars in the food chain and their vulnerability to predation. Caterpillars adopt different defense strategies such as cryptic, mimicry, and aposematism to protect themselves from predators. The cinnabar moth caterpillar is an example of a caterpillar that uses aposematism to signal toxicity and camouflage to avoid predation. The effectiveness of these defense strategies can be measured by studying the predation rates of predators using artificial caterpillar models. 

In this study, we use AC in four different areas of Freiburg(Germany) to test the following hypothesis: (1) The predation rates of the cryptic and aposematic caterpillars are the same (null hypothesis) or significantly different (alternative hypothesis) and (2) The color types of plant where these dummy caterpillars are installed have no effect (null hypothesis) or have a significant effect on the predation (alternative hypothesis)



## Method adapted
The study conducted was aimed at investigating the role of caterpillar coloration and background in determining predation risk. The study was conducted on four randomly selected locations in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany. The caterpillars were made of non-hardening plasticine and were of two types: pure green and yellow with black stripes. The AC was placed on two types of plants: Rockrose Polygala (RP) and any green plant (GP) without flowers. The plants with the AC were separated by at least 4m. After 72 hours, the AC were collected and examined for predation marks. The study found that the yellow and black striped caterpillars had higher predation rates, and the predation rate was significantly influenced by the background.

### Statistical Analysis
Chi-square test and General Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were used to analyze the data. The study found a correlation between predator type and caterpillar color, as well as a relationship between the quantified color contrast and predation risk. RGB and HSV values were obtained using ImageJ® software, and color contrast was calculated by the Euclidean distance between two colors in an HSV color space. Overall, the study provided insights into the factors affecting predation risk in caterpillars.

#### Experimental Design!
- Hypothesis 1:  P(predated | aposematic) = P(predated | cryptic)
- Hypothesis 2:  P(predation) ⊥ plant
